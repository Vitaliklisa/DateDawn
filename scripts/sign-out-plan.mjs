 * The sign-out sequence used by `src/lib/auth/client.ts`, kept here as a pure
 * module so its effects can be unit-tested (`node --test` only covers
 * `scripts/`).
 *
 * The two environments authenticate differently, so they need different
 * answers to "the server did not reply":
 *
 * - **Live preview** — a partitioned iframe with no readable session cookie;
 *   the session rides the bearer token in `sessionStorage`. Dropping that token
 *   IS being signed out, so the server call is best effort and a wedged request
 *   must never strand the button. This is where the hang actually happens.
 * - **Deployed** — the session rides an HttpOnly `__Host-` cookie that JS
 *   cannot delete. ONLY a completed sign-out response clears it, and
 *   `server.ts` enables `session.cookieCache` (maxAge 300), so `/get-session`
 *   would keep answering from the cached cookie for minutes afterwards.
 *   Redirecting on a timeout would show the visitor "signed out" while their
 *   session is still live — so here we fail loudly instead of pretending.
